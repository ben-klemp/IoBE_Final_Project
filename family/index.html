    <p>  The importance put on family background is shown most by Lady Bracknell while she is quizzing Jack.  She is perfectly fine with Jack up until she finds out that he doesn’t have any parents.  When she does find this out, she immediately asks Jack to produce a parent.  “I would strongly advise you, Mr Worthing, … to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.”(48)  When he states that he cannot, she refuses to allow him to get engaged to Gwendolen.  Then later, when it is found out that Jack is a member of a notable family, she immediately consents to the engagement.</p>
    <p>  This importance is also shown in the conversation surrounding Algernon’s engagement with Cecily.  Lady Bracknell is not particularly impressed with Cecily until she hears the amount that Cecily has to her name.  “A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A hundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.” (97)  As soon as Lady Bracknell knows this, she immediately tries to get Algernon married to Cecily.  She doesn’t care about her character at all, she just cares about her background and resulting fortune.  She even says this directly.  “To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.” (99)  This interaction shows the lack of importance put on anything meaningful, and the resulting importance of background and wealth.</p>
